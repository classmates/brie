This is brie [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/peopleconnectus/brie.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/peopleconnectus/brie)
=============
This Business Rules Integration Engine (B.R.I.E., or "brie") is a transient Feature Flipping Criteria System for Node.

```
npm install brie
```

## Getting Started
Below is a simple example that uses __brie__ to deliver feature flags based on a determined (set) of User Variant(s):
```javascript
// Include brie
var brie = require('brie');

// given an inbound data object called "user" plus a set of features (see below) called "featureSet"
brie.setup(
  {
    data: user,
    features: featureSet
  }
);
var flags = brie.getAll();
// expect {feature1: true, feature2: false, ... } from get() or getAll()
```

### Criteria
Criteria are the predefined rule types that __brie__ tests data against, per feature.  Each feature in the feature set consists of at least one criteria.  A feature may contain multiple criteria, joined across a logical "and" or "any" as dictated by the `criteriaLogic`:
```javascript
  var featureSet = multiPartTestCase : {
    criteria : [
      {
        has: {
          "trait": "messageCount",
          "comparison": "above",
          "value": 2
        }
      },
      {
        has: {
          "trait": "creationDate",
          "comparison": "older",
          "value": "12/Dec/2000"
        }
      }
    ],
    criteriaLogic: "any"
  };
// expect {multiPartTestCase: true} from get() and getAll()
```


__brie__ has:


#### allowIDs (object, array)
Provided an object containing an "id" property, brie evaluates the presence of the id in the given array, checking for 1 or more entries.

#### always (object, bool)
`Always` asks brie to "always" respond with the given input.  Why?  Code consistency, mainly.

#### percentScale(object, opts)
The `object.id` is used to calculate a percentage, modified by the salt value. If the resulting, salted, number is within range, returns true; otherwise false.

```
  opts = {
    percentMin:[0-1],
    percentMax:[0-1],
    salt:[number],
    testPhase:[string]
  }
```

`testPhase` is used for logging and debugging only, and does not impact the algorithm.

`salt` is used to allow the same `id` to map to a different boolean amongst the feature flags. Thus you can have one flag with the `{ percentMin: 0, percentMax: 50, salt:0.5 }` return true, and another with `{ percentMin: 0, percentMax: 50, salt: 0.9 }` return false. Conversely you can tie together a booleans using the same salt.

#### has(test data [object], comparison data [object])
The most complex criteria mechanism, `has` will evaluate the test data (first argument) against the trait, comparator and value provided in the second argument.  If the test data has the trait and the associated value evaluates properly considering the comparison value, then true is returned.

* Requires a data object
* Requires a set of comparison data containing the following properties:
  * trait (required) - the name of a property to find on data object.  If comparison and value are omitted, the evaluation will simply verify the existence of the property on the object.
  * comparison (optional) - one of an existing set of comparison instructions :
    * equals (string, date, number, object)
    * like (string)
    * below (string, date, number, object)
    * above (string, date, number, object)
    * longer (string, date, number, object)
    * shorter (string, date, number, object)
    * older (date)
    * younger (date)
  * value (optional) - static value for comparison

If the comparison object contains only `trait` then brie will evaluate the presence of the property on the data object. Comparison and value must be provided together, when one of them is provided.

**Note:** for the purpose of comparisons, "object" refers to both `object` and `array`, with the distinction being left up to the return value of the [_.isArray() method](https://lodash.com/docs#isArray).

Possible comparisons are:

##### equals
 * (`date`) - a **strict** equality check between base comparison date and check date.  If the check value is a number, then brie evaluates the difference between `now()` and the comparison date to be equal to the check value, in days (e.g. "0" implies "today").
 * (`numeric`) - a **non-strict** equality check.
 * (`object`) - a **deep comparison** equality check, using the [_.isEqual()](https://lodash.com/docs#isEqual) method from `lodash-node`.
 * (`string`) - a **strict** equality check that the comparison string is identical to the check value note that this is a case-sensitive check.  See "like", below.

##### above
 * (`date`) - [alias: "longer", "older"] checks to see that the comparison date is older than the check date.  If the check value is a number, brie checks to see that the comparison date is at least as old, in days, as the check value, compared to `now()` (e.g. "1" implies the date must be yesterday or older).
 * (`numeric`) - [alias: "longer"] a greater-than-or-equal-to check that the comparison number is greater than the check value.
 * (`object`) - an array or object is said to be "above" another if it fully contains the other.  That is: if the data object contains the comparison object, then the data object is above the comparison object.  If the objects are equal, the `above` comparison is inherently false.  If the data object is a non-array object but the comparison object is an array, then the [_.difference()](https://lodash.com/docs#difference) comparison is done between the keys of the data object and the comparison array.  If both data and comparison objects are arrays, a lodash [_.difference()](https://lodash.com/docs#difference) between comparison and data is compare with `[]`, indicating that the data object fully contains the comparison object.
 * (`string`) - performs a javascript string "greater-than-or-equal" comparison.  As a loosely-typed language, this could be anything, really.

##### below
 * (`date`) - [alias: "shorter", "younger"] checks to see that the comparison date is more recent than the check date.  If the check value is a number, brie checks to see that the comparison date is at least as new, in days, as the check value, compared to `now()` (e.g. "1" implies the date must be tomorrow or younger).
 * (`numeric`) - [alias: "shorter"] a less-than-or-equal-to check that the comparison number is smaller than the check value.
 * (`object`) - an array or object is said to be "below" another if it is fully contained in the other.  That is: if the comparison object contains the data object, then the data object is below the comparison object.  If the objects are equal, the `below` comparison is inherently false.  If the data object is a non-array object but the comparison object is an array, then the [_.difference()](https://lodash.com/docs#difference) comparison is done between the keys of the data object and the comparison array.  If both data and comparison objects are arrays, a lodash [_.difference()](https://lodash.com/docs#difference) between comparison and data is compare with `[]`, indicating that the data object fully contains the comparison object.
 * (`string`) - performs a javascript string "less-than-or-equal" comparison.  As a loosely-typed language, this could be anything, really.

##### like
 * (`string`) - a **non-strict** check that the `toLowerCase()` comparison string is equal to the `toString().toLowerCase()` check value.

##### longer
 * (`object`) - true if the [_.size()](https://lodash.com/docs#size) of the data object is greater than that of the comparison object.
 * (`string`) - true if the length of the comparison string (non-trimmed) is greater than or equal to the length of the check value (non-trimmed).

##### shorter
 * (`object`) - true if the [_.size()](https://lodash.com/docs#size) of the data object is less than that of the comparison object.
 * (`string`) - true if the length of the comparison string (non-trimmed) is less than or equal to the length of the check value (non-trimmed).

#### is (object (source), object (options))
Tests if a key from a source object has property of a noted __type__.
##### Options
 * (`trait`) - JSON notation path reference for a key, presumed to exist in source data.  Checks source data using lodash [_.get()](https://lodash.com/docs/#get), and follows dot-path rules.
 * (`type`) - string representing potential data type. String case is adjusted in the `is` method, but value must be one of:
   * array
   * boolean
   * date (**NOTE:** a value like `Tue Feb 28 2017 20:42:48 GMT-0800 (PST)` is a _string_ type and not _date_.)
   * empty
   * finite
   * function
   * integer
   * NaN
   * nil
   * null
   * number
   * object
   * regex \| regular_expression \| regexp
   * string
   * undefined
### Features
Features contain sets of criteria to test users against. The value associated with the criteria is passed in as the data argument of the criteria function. A user will have a featured enabled if they match all listed criteria, otherwise the feature is disabled. Features can include other optional properties for context. Features are described as follows:
```javascript
var ExampleFeaturesObject = {
  "canCheckAlways": {
    "criteria": [
      {
        "always": false
      }
    ]
  },
  "canCheckHasString": {
    "criteria": [
      {
        "has": {
          "trait": "hasStringValue",
          "comparison": "equals",
          "value": "a string check value"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "canCheckType": {
    "criteria": [
      {
        "is": {
          "trait": "myData.nested.key",
          "type": "number"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "canCheckHigherNumber": {
    "criteria": [
      {
        "has": {
          "trait": "hasNumberValue",
          "comparison": "above",
          "value": 1
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "canCheckLowerDate": {
    "criteria": [
      {
        "has": {
          "trait": "hasDateValue",
          "comparison": "younger",
          "value": new Date(2000, 1, 1, 1, 22, 0)
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Usage
```
Object setup(options)         // brie needs to be initialized with a data object and a set of features.  Don't try to make brie do stuff without setting up first. That makes brie angry.
Bool   get(string feature)    // asks brie if the feature is enabled.
Object getAll()               // requests the full evaluation of features from brie
```
### Setup
In the setup (initializer), brie accepts:
* (`object`) - data: a object structure containing the data to be tested.
* (`object`) - features: see feature section, above.
* (`object`) - overrides: containing properties that match feature names, an override is a simple set of boolean boolean values to force a feature into a state.

  ```
    {
      "canCheckAlways": true
    }
  ```
* (`bool`) - showLogs: when true, brie is verbose about the request activities.

Returns `brie`.

Once initialized, via `setup()`, brie can be queried for the outcome of any or all features.

### get
`get` returns the outcome of a single feature, and requires the string name of the feature, as an argument, and is invoked as
```javascript
var isHigherNumber = brie.get('canCheckHigherNumber');
// isHigherNumber = true;
```

### getAll
`getAll` returns a hash of all features and their evaluated value, including overrides, as a shallow javascript object.
```javascript
var allFeatures = brie.getAll();
// allFeatures = {
// canCheckAlways: true,
// canCheckHasString: true,
// canCheckHigherNumber: false,
// canCheckLowerDate: false
// }
```

### Chaining
A single method can be chained against the `setup` method. `setup` returns `brie`, which has both a `get` and `getAll` method.  Further chaining is not available, since `get` returns a boolean and `getAll` returns an object.
```javascript
var allFeatures = brie.setup({
    data: data_in,
    features: flags_in,
    overrides: overrides,
    showLogs: true
}).getAll()
```
